## What you need to perform this module (placeholder)

### Required skills (placeholder)

The following skills and background knowledge are required for this module.

-   [Principles of remote sensing](../module0/module0.md#remote-sensing)
-   ...

Follow the links for more information on specific prerequisites and recommendations on external material for preparation.

### Software

For this module, you will need the software listed below. If you did not install the software before starting the course, follow the links to the individual software or tools, for help in setting them up.

-   [QGIS](../software/software_qgis.md) for visualization of time series satellite imagery and results of classification and detection
-   [R language](../software/software_r_language.md) + [Python](../software/software_python.md) for time series satellite imagery processing and analysis

### Use Cases and Data --- filler for now

This module uses \<type of data, e.g. Sentinel images> from the use case [<name>](link-to-general-description%20in%20module0).
