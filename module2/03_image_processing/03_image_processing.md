# Image processing workflow

Automating of satellite data processing.


## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about:
* [Goals of automating processes](#goals-of-automating-processes)<br>
* [Radiometric and geometric calibration](#radiometric-and-geometric-calibration)<br>
* [Different sensors harmonization](#different-sensors-harmonization)<br>
* [Masking processes](#masking-processes)<br>
* [Time composites creation](#time-composites-creation)<br>
* [Overview of R packages dealing with multispectral image processing](#overview-of-R-packages dealing-with-multispectral-image-processing)<br>

After finishing this theme you will be able to complete the process of preparing data for actual use in research. The goal is to present methods and tools that allow fast, reproducible and accurate data processing. 

## Goals of automating processes

* standarization, time saving

## Radiometric and geometric calibration



## Different sensors harmonization

* Landsat TM-OLI, resampling

## Masking processes

* clouds and shadow mask building, spectral index based masks of objectsâ€¦

## Time composites creation

Results: Concept of time composite ![Concept of time composite](img/composite.png)
Figure X. Concept of creating time composites from three different dates images based on the highest NDVI value.

## Examples 

e.g. from literature 


## Exercise 

Creating analysis ready time-series composition from data downloaded through all presented processing steps using [R](../../software/software_r_language.md) and [QGIS](../../software/software_qgis.md) for visualisation.
