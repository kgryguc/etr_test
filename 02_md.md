# Temporal information in satellite data

As you know from the previous theme, no other level of data acquisition
allows for analysis at regular intervals from the beginning of work of
the instrument than the satellite level. This results in a collection of
**huge amounts of data**, e.g. Landsat has collected more than 8 million
scenes of Earth since the start of the mission. So here we would like to
present the potential of the multitemporal aspect of a large volume of
such data in Earth observation analysis.

## Objectives

After reading through theoretical contents this theme you will learn how
to:<br> - [indicate satellite sensors with high or low temporal
resolution](#resolution)<br> - [recognize the types of multitemporal
analysis](#temporal-analysis)<br> - [list key aspects of satellite time
series data analysis](#aspects)<br> - [divide satellite data into
categories depending on temporal resolution](#monitoring)<br> - [define
different types of changes on satellite data](#changes)<br> - [address
uncertainty in the results](#uncertainty)<br> - [differentiate several
change detection algorithms](#methods)<br>

After performing the [exercise](#exercise) in this theme you will be
able to: - identify date of change based on visual image interpretation
and spectral indices values - recognise change agents based on spectral
indices values - recreate presented steps to prepare your own reference
dataset

## Temporal resolution of selected sensors

The temporal resolution of satellite data from different sensors depends
on the type of orbit on which the satellite is placed. Geostationary
satellite systems continuously acquire images of the same part of the
globe, so multiple data acquisitions can occur even on the same day or
even within a few minutes. Examples of such systems are meteorological
satellites such as Meteosat and NOAA. Another class of satellites
includes systems orbiting in polar orbits, like Landsat or SPOT
missions. In their case, time resolution is defined as the time the
satellite revisits the same part of a given area. Typically, it takes
between one day and half a month for a satellite in polar orbit to make
another acquisition. This time can be reduced by placing several
satellites with twin sensor parameters in the same polar orbit, like in
case of Sentinel-2.

Overview of temporal resolution of selected satellite sensors is
presented in Figure 1 below.

## Satellite data archives

-   EarthExplorer, ESA etc.

## Types of temporal analysis

-   intra-annual, year-to-year, multi-year

Depending on temporal resolution of satellite data and its time range
multitemporal analysis can be divided in following categories: -
intra-annual - analysed data are acquired within the same year
(e.g. analysis of phenological changes in one season), - inter-annual
(year-to-year) - analysed data are acquired in two different years with
any interval (e.g. analysis of the hurricane or flood effects), -
inter-annual (multi-year) - analysed data are acquired in more than two
different years with any interval (e.g. analysis of the pest infestation
or climate change effects).

## Types of changes on satellite data

-   definitions of abrupt, gradual changes

Temporal-scale changes in satellite time series data can be abrupt and
gradual, where the first one refers to short-term, large magnitude, and
the second one refers to long-term, small magnitude date-to-date changes
(Zhu 2017). Abrupt changes can be caused by disturbance agents such as
fires, floods or deforestation. Gradual changes can be caused by climate
changes or land management.

There are also seasonal changes related to plant phenology.
